print("\n This upcoming summer, I would like to learn many new skills; I plan to start more projects through a maker space called Gizmo. Another skill that I would like to broaden is my use of computers. I may install a Linux operating system on my computer to learn how a computer operates on a more basic level. Additionally, I would like to apply for possible internships to further my career.")

print("\n 2. What do you personally want to get out of this lab?")

print("\n I personally am excited to be able to comprehend Latex on a deeper level; the last time I attempted to learn it, I was frustrated and gave up since there was no purpose for me to use it. However, this class will allow me to discover a new way to format papers professionally. By messing around with the formatting and looking up the formatting on the provided cheat sheet, I was able to understand it better. I am also exhilarated to be able to learn python. I previously taught myself some python over break, and I am excited to not only test my knowledge, but also learn more about python.")
